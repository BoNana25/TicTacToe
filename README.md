TicTacToe
=========

This is still a work in progress. What's available so far is playing against the computer and against a friend. You can not overwrite the other players X or O

1. The computer being able to find 3 X's or O's in a row has not been entered.
2. If you accidentally type the wrong int, you can not go back. TAKE YOUR TIME! (Working on it)
3. Overwriting other players X's or O's will not work. Instead, it will say "This spot is already taken.")
4. When playing against the computer, it will choose a random name from a list of girl names or boy names.
