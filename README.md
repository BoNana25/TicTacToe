TicTacToe
=========

1. If you accidentally type the wrong int, you can not go back. TAKE YOUR TIME!
2. Overwriting other players X's or O's will not work. Instead, it will say "This spot is already taken."
3. When playing against the computer, it will choose a random name from a list of girl names or boy names.
